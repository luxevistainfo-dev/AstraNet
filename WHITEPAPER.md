# AstraNet Whitepaper

## Abstract
AstraNet is a decentralized testnet network that combines blockchain mechanics with AI-driven features. The goal is to demonstrate a transparent, auditable, and easily reproducible system.

## Introduction
Inspired by Bitcoin, AstraNet introduces new economic mechanisms: transaction fees, burn, staking, and dynamic pricing. The system is designed to be beginner-friendly and allow fast testing and learning.

## Core Design
- Blocks and transactions  
- Mining with proof-of-work  
- Wallets with RSA keys and digital signatures  

## Economy
- Transaction fees (1%)  
- Burn mechanism (2%)  
- Staking rewards  
- Supply tracking  
- Dynamic price based on active users  

## AI Integration
- AI helper for transaction analysis  
- Future integration with external AI APIs  

## Conclusion
AstraNet shows how blockchain and AI can merge into a transparent, auditable, and scalable system that is easy to understand and use.
